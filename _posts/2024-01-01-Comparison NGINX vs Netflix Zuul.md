and the **Netflix Zuul** Netflix Zuul is a dynamic and scalable gateway service that provides various functionalities for microservices architectures, particularly in the context of Netflix's ecosystem. It is part of Netflix's open-source suite of tools known as the Netflix Open Source Software (OSS).
